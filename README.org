#+title: orgroamtools ðŸ““ðŸ”¬

=orgroamtools= is an in-progress Python library to analyze =org-roam= zettelkastens inspired heavily by [[https://github.com/mfarragher/obsidiantools][obsidiantools]].
Since the zettelkasten method creates a natural graph structure out of you personal knowledgebase, we can use graph analysis tools to learn about your digital "slipbox".
This library is meant to aid in doing so, all you need is a healthy =org-roam= v2 database!
You can locate this database in the =.emacs/.local/cache= directory where it is stored by default, or wherever you have placed it.

Load the data into memory with
#+begin_src python
from orgroamtools.RoamGraph import RoamGraph

slipbox = RoamGraph(PATH_TO_ROAM_DB)
#+end_src

* Features
- =networkx= graph of =org-roam= database
  - What you do with this is limited only by the capabilities of =networkx=, which is very powerful for analyzing and visualizing graphs
