#+title: orgroamtools ðŸ““ðŸ”¬

[[file:viz/COVER.svg]]

=orgroamtools= is an in-progress reproduction of [[https://github.com/mfarragher/obsidiantools][obsidiantools]]--a tool used to aid in analysis of Obsidian vaults--but for =org-roam= collections.

This library is meant to aid in data analysis of =org-roam= collections, all you need is a healthy =org-roam= v2 database.
Locate this database by checking the value of =(org-roam-db-location)= in Emacs.


*Note:* Though =org-roam= allows different nodes with the same title, it HIGHLY recommended that the notes in your collection have unique titles.
For better ergonomics, it is possible to retrieve nodes out of your =RoamGraph= by title.
This library will not stop you from persisting with duplicated titles, but you will be warned whenever the ambiguity might prevent desired behavior.

* Dependencies
- Python 3.10+
- =networkx=: a graph analysis library for Python
- =orgparse=: a Python library for parsing =org-mode= files
* Getting Started
Install the library in a virtual environment if desired:
#+begin_src sh
python3 -m pip install orgroamtools
#+end_src
Import the library and pass in your database path:
#+begin_src python
from orgroamtools.data import RoamGraph
collection = RoamGraph(PATH_TO_ORG_ROAM_DB)
#+end_src

Documentation and features for the library can be read [[https://aatmunbaxi.github.io/orgroamtools][here]].
